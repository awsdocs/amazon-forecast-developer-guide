# Stopping Resources<a name="stop-resource"></a>

 The Amazon Forecast `Stop Resource` \([`StopResource`](API_StopResource.md)\) operation stops a resource job that is in progress\. You can stop the following resource jobs: 
+ Dataset group import \(`CreateDatasetImportJob`\)
+ Predictor training \(`CreateAutoPredictor` and `CreatePredictor`\)
+ Predictor backtest export \(`CreatePredictorBacktestExportJob`\)
+ Forecast \(`CreateForecast`\)
+ Forecast export \(`CreateForecastExportJob`\)

You can't resume a resource job after it has stopped\. 

Stopping a resource ends its workflow, but doesn't delete the resource\. You can still preview the resource parameters in the console and with the [`Describe`](API_Operations_Amazon_Forecast_Service.md) operation\. 

When you stop a predictor or forecast job, you are billed for resources used up to the point when the job stopped\. 

You can stop a resource job using the Forecast console or the AWS Software Development Kit \(SDK\)\.
