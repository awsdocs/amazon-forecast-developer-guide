# Holidays Featurization<a name="holidays"></a>

 Holidays is a built\-in featurization that incorporates a feature\-engineered dataset of national holiday information into your model\. It provides native support for the holiday calendars of 66 countries\. To view the holiday calendars, refer to the [Jollyday library](http://jollyday.sourceforge.net/data.html)\. 

 The Holidays featurization is especially useful in the retail domain, where public holidays can significantly affect demand\.

## Enabling the Holidays Featurization<a name="enabling-holidays"></a>

The Holidays featurization is included in Amazon Forecast as an [Additional Dataset](API_AdditionalDataset.md), and is enabled before training a predictor\. After you choose a country, Holidays applies that countryâ€™s holiday calendar to every item in your dataset during training\.

 You can enable Holidays using the Amazon Forecast console or the Forecast Software Development Kit \(SDK\)\.

------
#### [ Forecast SDK ]

Using the [`CreateAutoPredictor`](API_CreateAutoPredictor.md) operation, enable Holidays by adding `"Name": "holiday`" and setting `"Configuration"` to map `"CountryCode"` a two\-letter country code\. See [Country Codes](#holidays-country-codes)\.

For example, to include the USA holiday calendar, use the following code\.

```
      "DataConfig": {          
        "AdditionalDatasets": [          
            {             
                "Name": "holiday",            
                "Configuration": {
                    "CountryCode" : ["US"]
                }      
            },      
          ]   
        },
```

#### [ Forecast Console ]
